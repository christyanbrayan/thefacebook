# [thefacebook]

The first version of Facebook (formerly called Thefacebook) home page was launched in February 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room.

The [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) has archived the front end of the page [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20040212031928/http://www.thefacebook.com/). In this repository, the code has been updated to tableless layout, semantic elements and other more modern web development techniques. Hosted with GH Pages.
